## Recent Changes (Aug 2025)
- Removed local `international_universities.json` and `uop_majors.json` dependencies.
- Integrated [Sheety API](https://sheety.co/) to fetch live data directly from Google Sheets/Excel.
- Benefits:
  - No need to redeploy app for data changes.
  - Countries, universities, and majors dropdowns update automatically when sheet is edited.
  - Cleaner state management since normalization happens on API response.
- Required columns in Sheety sheet:
  - **General tab**: `country`, `partner_university`, `partner_course_code`, `partner_course_name`, `pacific_course_code`, `pacific_course_name`, `pacific_major`, etc.
  - **Majors tab**: `major` (list of majors offered at UOP).
